# ðŸ“Š COVID-19 Interactive Dashboard

## 1. Project Title 
**COVID-19 Global Statistics Dashboard**  
A dynamic and interactive data visualization tool that helps users explore the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and continents using updated metrics from Worldometer.

---

## 2. Short Description / Purpose
The **COVID-19 Global Statistics Dashboard** is a Power BI report that visually tracks pandemic metrics including total cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and percentages like recovery and death rates.  
It provides an insightful overview of the pandemicâ€™s status by region and helps users understand data trends through charts, tables, and slicers.

---

## 3. Tech Stack
This dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** â€“ Primary platform for visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Power Query Editor** â€“ Used for data transformation, custom columns, and cleaning  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ For creating calculated measures like death rate %, recovery rate %, and active cases  
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Relationships between countries, continents, and date filters  
- **File Formats** â€“ `.pbix` for Power BI and `.png` for snapshots

---

## 4. Data Source

**Source:** Worldometer COVID-19 public data (manually imported or web scraped)

**Dataset Includes:**
- Country and continent names  
- Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered  
- Computed metrics like Death Rate %, Recovery Rate %, Active Cases  
- Optional: Add artificial waves (Wave 1, Wave 2) or cumulative days for timeline views

---

## 5. Features / Highlights

### â€¢ Business Problem
Lack of an easy-to-understand, dynamic visualization to track COVID-19 trends globally and regionally.

### â€¢ Goal of the Dashboard
To create an easy-to-navigate dashboard that:
- Highlights global pandemic impact with KPIs  
- Tracks trends and changes in active cases and deaths  
- Compares country-wise performance  
- Supports decision-making for healthcare planners, analysts, and researchers

## 6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

- **KPI Cards:**  
  Display Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Recovery Rate %, and Death Rate % at a glance.

- **Bar Chart â€“ Active Cases by Country:**  
  Compares the number of unresolved (active) cases per country.

- **Stacked Bar Chart â€“ Total Deaths, Recovered, and Active Cases:**  
  Shows the overall breakdown of pandemic outcomes per country or continent.

- **Line Chart â€“ Trend Over Time (Optional):**  
  Visualize how cases, deaths, or recoveries change over days/weeks. Use waves or relative date columns as X-axis.

- **Matrix Table â€“ Country-wise Comparison:**  
  Includes detailed numbers per country, with columns for each major metric.

- **Decomposition Tree â€“ Total Cases â†’ Continent â†’ Country:**  
  Drill-down analysis to identify where the most cases are coming from.

- **Gauge Chart â€“ Recovered vs Total Cases:**  
  Shows progress toward full recovery (optional, use sparingly due to space).

- **Slicers â€“ Filters:**  
  Filter by Continent, Country, and custom date/wave ranges to interactively explore data.

## 7. Calculated Columns / Measures Used

- **Active Cases:**  
  ```powerquery
  = [TotalCases] - [TotalDeaths] - [TotalRecovered]

- **Death Rate %:**  
  ```powerquery
  = ([TotalDeaths] / [TotalCases]) * 100

- **Recovery Rate %:**  
  ```powerquery
  = ([TotalRecovered] / [TotalCases]) * 100

- **Optional: Wave Grouping (Custom Reporting Periods)**  
  ```powerquery
  = if [TotalCases] < 100000 then "Wave 1" 
  else if [TotalCases] < 1000000 then "Wave 2" 
  else "Wave 3"
